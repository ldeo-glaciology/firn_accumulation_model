# Firn thickness, grain size, accumulation model

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/363214644.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/363214644)

Code to solve the nondimensional firn compaction model presented in the, preprint article *Grain-size evolution controls the accumulation dependence ofmodeled isothermal firn thickness*. 

This paper is unpublished/unreviewed, but will be availible in preprint form soon and a link to the paper will be provided here when it is. 

All code needed to produce the figures from the manuscript is contained in the directory *model*. All the resulting figures are previded as pngs.

Run `plottingScripts.m` to plot and save new versions of all the figures.
